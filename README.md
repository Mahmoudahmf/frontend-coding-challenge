# Front-end Coding Challenge

## Idea of the App

The task is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API (Github API explained down below).

## Dependencies (External Libraries)

- Ngx-infinite-scroll library used for making pagination to our repos list to not
  load all the repos to the DOM for UX enhancements

- Moment library used for date formating and transforming
